        modeling. For my analysis I mainly use R and Python supported by Hadoop, github and –lab, Alteryx, SPSS Modeller,
        Jenkins and many more. I gathered experience in different cloud services working for example with Google Cloud Services
        or Amazon Web Services. To put it in a nutshell I love to solve challenging problems using various tools and all kind
        of data. I enjoy working in mixed team - the more variety and new ideas the better. <br>
        As a data science consultant I traveled Germany to help different clients to create impact using data. I built
        models in sectors like health insurance, retail or housing and supported clients building their own analytics
        capability and data science infrastructure. During my Ph.D. I work part-time for a online- and app-based platform
        that offers a range of services like job, car or housing markets. With more than 15 million users there is a
        great data base to create massive value add for the firm with our analysis.<br>
        During my Ph.D. at the Cologne Institute for Information Systems I focus on User Generated Data (UGC) of various
        sources like retail reviews, social networks or blog articles. Based on the extracting information using Natural 
        Language Processing methods, I work on time series models to predict the
        future user opinions and needs."""
